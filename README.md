# MIRocchio Classification Algorithm
Prototype based classification algorithm for multiple-instance data

In contrasts to regular classification problems, in which each example has a unique description, in multiple-instance classification (MIC) problems, each example has many descriptions. In MIC, each example is called <em>bag</em>, and each description of a bag is an <em>instance</em>. In prototype based classification algorithm, a prototype is as an example that is computed for every class. When classifying a new example, the distance from the example to each prototype is calculated, and it is assigned to the class with the closer prototype. In the case of multiple-instance classification, the prototype is a bag. We used a variation of the Rocchio's formula to calculate the prototypes. This classification algorithm has proven to be useful for textual classification applications. More details can be found in
